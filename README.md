# CLASS_EDE-v3: CLASS v3 for Early Dark Energy

The same modified version of [CLASS](https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public) with Early Dark Energy (EDE) as done in [CLASS_EDE](https://github.com/mwt5345/class_ede/blob/master/README.md). Only difference is the version of [CLASS](https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public) on which the codes are based. This version is based on CLASS v3.1.0 so [HyRec](https://github.com/nanoomlee/HYREC-2) can be used for recombination with EDE (there was an issue in CLASS v2 so HyRec can't be used properly with non-standard modification beyond *\Lambda CDM* which impacts the Hubble rate).
